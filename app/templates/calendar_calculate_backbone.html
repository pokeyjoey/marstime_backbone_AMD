    <h2>Calculating a Martian Date</h2>

        <P><BR>Calculating a Martian date is not too difficult. The trickiest part is 
        figuring out what day it is on Earth. It's not enough to say, "It's 23 November 
        1993, dummy." You need to know, instead, how far along in the year you are. Is 
        November 23 the 314th day of the year, 336th, 202nd, what? You could add up the 
        days from January through October and add 23. You could simply pull out a 
        calendar and count the days. Or you could fudge it a bit and do the following: 
        multiply the number of full months that have passed by 30.4, (the average number 
        of days in an Earthly month) and then add the number of days that have passed in 
        the month in question. In the case of November 23 that would be 10 months 
        (January through October) times 30.4, or 304. Add 23 and you have 327. To figure 
        out how far along you are in the year, simply divide the number of days by 365 - 
        in this case you would divide 327 by 365 and end up with 0.896 - you're 
        896/1000ths of the way through the year. This may seem a bit esoteric, but it 
        necessary for calculating Martian dates.<BR><BR>To calculate the Martian date 
        for an Earth date, you use the following equation: Mars date =&nbsp;(8/15) * 
        (Earth date - 1961) +1."Earth date" in this equation is composed of the year, 
        plus that bit of esoteric information, how far along you are in the year. So, 
        for purposes of translating to a Martian date, 23 November 1993 becomes 1993 + 
        0.896, or 1993.896. Now your ready to undertake some math, to wit: (8/15) * 
        (1993.896 - 1961) +1. And the answer is ... 18.544. What does that tell you? 
        Think of it as the Martian equivalent of the Earth date you used in the equation 
        - the integer portion gives you the year, the remainder how far along you are in 
        the year. Ergo. 183544 indicates that you're 544/1000ths through the Martian 
        year 18.<BR><BR>To determine the Martian month and sol, simply work backwards 
        from the fact that you're 544/1000ths of the way through a Martian year. 
        Multiplying 669 (the number of sols in a Martian year) by .544results in sol 
        364. From the table above, you can see that sol 364 resides in the Martian month 
        of Scorpius, which begins on sol 318. Subtracting 318 from 364 gives you sol 46. 
        Since Martian months (like Earth Months) begin on sol 1 (it's November 1, not 
        November 0), add 1 to the sol number: 46 + 1 = 47. The date? 47 Scorpius 
        XVIII.</P>
