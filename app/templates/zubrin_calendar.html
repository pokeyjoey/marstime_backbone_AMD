<P><B>Note:</B> This is a reprint of an article published in Ad Astra, the 
magazine of the National Space Society (Ad Astra, Nov/Dec93, vol. 5 Issue 6, 
p25). This material is reproduced with the permission of the author, Dr. Robert 
Zubrin.</P>
<P>Mars needs a&nbsp;calendar - using Earth dates just won't do. If I tell you 
it is February 1, you know that it is freezing in Minneapolis and high summer in 
Sydney, but what does it tell you about conditions on Mars?<BR><BR>The idea of a 
Martian calendar and timekeeping system is not original, and many have been 
designed in the past. Edgar Rice Burroughs developed an intricate calendar 
system for his Barsoomian civilization. But the problem with Burrough's, and all 
the successor Martian time systems that I have seen, is that they are not 
physical - they bear no relation to the Martian seasons or to the timekeeping 
needs of Mars surface navigation. Furthermore, the authors of such systems have 
neglected to provide a&nbsp;method of converting Martian dates to terrestrial 
ones, and vice-versa.<BR><BR>Now devising a&nbsp;Martian calendar is a&nbsp;bit 
trickier than it might seem at first. Mars has a year consisting of 669 Martian 
days, or "sols", each of which consists of 24 hours and 39.6 minutes of 
terrestrial time. Most previous calendars have simply divided this up into 
convenient subdivisions, such as 12 months of 55 to&nbsp;56 sols each. 
Time-keeping systems have usually preserved terrestrial clock units, with an 
interstitial partial hour thrown in at some time of the day, or else employed 
some totally novel, usually decimal-based clock.<BR><BR>Such equipartitioned 
months don't work for Mars because Mars orbit is elliptical, which causes it's 
seasons to be of unequal length. And a clock that uses unequal hours would be a 
nightmare for those attempting navigation or astronomy from the Martian surface, 
while a decimal or other novelty would probably be disorienting and in any case 
would a correspondingly complete overhaul of the system of surface geographical 
co-ordinates in order to make it's use convenient.<BR><BR>The practical answer 
to the clock problem is simple - just divide up the Martian day into 24 Martian 
hours, each composed of 60 Martian minutes, each of which is composed of 60 
Martian seconds. The&nbsp;conversion facto between Martian days, hours, minutes, 
and seconds and their terrestrial equivalents would thus be 1.0275 across the 
board. A&nbsp;time of day on Mars, say 9a.m, would have exactly the same 
physical significance with regard to the orientation of the planet towards the 
Sun as it does on Earth. All the equations of celestial navigation would also 
remain valid, although stellar latitude measurements would have to be taken with 
respect to the Martian pole star, which is located at 21.18 hours right 
ascension, 52.89 north declination (about halfway between Deneb and Alpha 
Cephei).<BR><BR>Such a clock solves all the practical problems associated with 
daily time keeping on Mars. Unfortunately, such a clock would annoy Physicists 
who regard the terrestrial second as the sacrosanct fundamental unit of physical 
time. They shouldn't worry - Martian crystallographers and others who require a 
high degree of precision in quoting their measurements of frequencies and 
whatnot can still quote their measurements in terms of terrestrial seconds. The 
Standard International system of physical units can remain intact. However, for 
purposes of operating on Mars, the terrestrial second is no more a useful unit 
of time-keeping than the terrestrial day, and must yield to its Martian 
counterpart.<BR><BR><BR>The calendar is a more interesting problem. In order to 
predict the seasons, a calendar must divide the&nbsp;planet's orbit not into 
equal divisions of days, but into equal angles of travel around the Sun. If we 
want months to be useful units and choose to retain the terrestrial definition 
of a month as a twelfth of a year, then a month really is 30 degrees of travel 
around the Sun.<BR><BR>So, we have our months, but what should we name them? 
Using terrestrial month names could be confusing, and a&nbsp;totally new system 
would be completely arbitrary. However, there is a set of names available which 
has long been universally known to humanity and which has real physical 
significance not only to Mars, but to any planet in our solar system - the signs 
of the zodiac.<BR><BR>All the constellations of the zodiac lie in the plane of 
the planets. Ancient astrologers, having a geocentric (Earth - centered) point 
of view, named the months for whatever zodiacal constellation the Sun appeared 
to be located in as viewed from Earth. An interplanetary culture, though, must 
adopt a heliocentric (Sun - centered) point of view. Therefore, I have chosen to 
name the Martian months for whatever constellation mars would be found in as 
seen from the Sun.<BR><BR>For Martian colonists the sign of the month would be 
seen high in the sky during the midnight hours of a given month. It is currently 
the custom among planetary scientists to start a planet's year with the vernal 
equinox (the beginning of spring in the northern hemisphere, March 21 on 
Earth),and so, consistent with that custom, the Martian year begins with the 
month of Gemini and ends with Taurus.<BR><BR>Now for a complete system of 
dating, it is necessary not only to know he month of a&nbsp;year, &nbsp;but also 
what year it is in some absolute sense - you need some year "I". For this year 
the corresponding terrestrial year is 1961. It happens that the first day of the 
year, 1 January 1961, coincides with the first day of the Martian year, 1 
Gemini. In addition, 1961 was the latest year prior to the commencement of Mars 
exploration where this held true. The notation I've adopted for this calendar 
places the day of the month first, followed by the name of the month followed by 
the year in&nbsp;Roman numerals. Thus the calendar starts with 1 Gemini 
I.<BR><BR>While such a calendar may be interesting, it is still difficult for 
residents of Earth to use, unless a means can be provided to convert Earth dates 
to mars dates. I have invented such a device, which I call an "areogator." You 
can use it to find the month (and therefore season) on Mars during any chosen 
month on Earth, or vice - versa; the relative positions and angles of Earth and 
Mars about the Sun; as well as where in the sky Mars will be as seen from Earth, 
or&nbsp;vice-versa, at any given time in the past or future.<BR><BR>It's my firm 
belief that we now posses the technology that could allow a human landing on 
Mars within 10 years of the time a decision is made to launch the program. It's 
now 1993, and it's worth noting that 2003 would be a particularly good year to 
launch a first Mars expedition, since a low energy trajectory is possible that 
year that would get astronauts to Mars in just 126 days. Launch would take place 
June 22, arrival would be October 26. On arrival at Mars the date will be 46 
Pisces XXIII, and the dust storm season will be drawing to a close. Shortly 
after capture into orbit, the last of the clouds will lift, revealing the 
surface of Mars in fine southern weather, and a landing will be called for. 
It'll be about time.</P>

<P><BR>Calculating a Martian date is not too difficult. The trickiest part is 
figuring out what day it is on Earth. It's not enough to say, "It's 23 November 
1993, dummy." You need to know, instead, how far along in the year you are. Is 
November 23 the 314th day of the year, 336th, 202nd, what? You could add up the 
days from January through October and add 23. You could simply pull out a 
calendar and count the days. Or you could fudge it a bit and do the following: 
multiply the number of full months that have passed by 30.4, (the average number 
of days in an Earthly month) and then add the number of days that have passed in 
the month in question. In the case of November 23 that would be 10 months 
(January through October) times 30.4, or 304. Add 23 and you have 327. To figure 
out how far along you are in the year, simply divide the number of days by 365 - 
in this case you would divide 327 by 365 and end up with 0.896 - you're 
896/1000ths of the way through the year. This may seem a bit esoteric, but it 
necessary for calculating Martian dates.<BR><BR>To calculate the Martian date 
for an Earth date, you use the following equation: Mars date =&nbsp;(8/15) * 
(Earth date - 1961) +1."Earth date" in this equation is composed of the year, 
plus that bit of esoteric information, how far along you are in the year. So, 
for purposes of translating to a Martian date, 23 November 1993 becomes 1993 + 
0.896, or 1993.896. Now your ready to undertake some math, to wit: (8/15) * 
(1993.896 - 1961) +1. And the answer is ... 18.544. What does that tell you? 
Think of it as the Martian equivalent of the Earth date you used in the equation 
- the integer portion gives you the year, the remainder how far along you are in 
the year. Ergo. 183544 indicates that you're 544/1000ths through the Martian 
year 18.<BR><BR>To determine the Martian month and sol, simply work backwards 
from the fact that you're 544/1000ths of the way through a Martian year. 
Multiplying 669 (the number of sols in a Martian year) by .544results in sol 
364. From the table above, you can see that sol 364 resides in the Martian month 
of Scorpius, which begins on sol 318. Subtracting 318 from 364 gives you sol 46. 
Since Martian months (like Earth Months) begin on sol 1 (it's November 1, not 
November 0), add 1 to the sol number: 46 + 1 = 47. The date? 47 Scorpius 
XVIII.</P>

<P>You don't need a sixth sense to determine where Mars is at any given time - 
just six cents, if you use the areogator.</P>
<P align=center><BR><IMG height=527 
src="/static/images/marstime/areogator.gif" width=531></P>
<P><BR>Lets say you want to know the position of Mars during a given year, 1993 
for example. Place a penny, representing Mars, on the diamond on Mars' orbit 
(red) labeled "93", and a nickel, representing Earth, on the diamond on Earth's 
orbit (blue) at the beginning of January. These were the comparative positions 
of Earth and Mars around 1 January 1993. Note how close they are together, and 
that Mars was on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun. Such an 
arrangement is called an "opposition," and as a result, Mars was bright and high 
in the sky around midnight during January 1993. You can also see that it was 
mid-Gemini, or early spring in the northern hemisphere on Mars at that time. To 
move forward in time, just move Mars (the penny) forward one diamond and Earth 
(the nickel) one diamond as well. You can see that by mid-February, Earth has 
passed Mars, which is now in the month of Cancer. Move the Earth forward four 
more diamonds to mid-August, the time Mars Observer was due at Mars, and Mars 
forward four diamonds. You can see that when Mars Observer vanished, it was the 
middle of the month of Libra, or mid-Summer in the Northern hemisphere on Mars. 
Counting forward, you can see that it would take four more diamonds before Mars 
enters the month of Capricorn, the beginning of the dust storm season, and this 
corresponds to February 1994. You can also see that about that time Mars and 
Earth will be on opposite sides of the Sun from each other.<BR><BR>If you want 
to plan a mission for the year 2001, just repeat the procedure , placing your 
Mars marker at the 01 diamond (in Virgo), and your Earth marker at January 1, 
and start move them forward in tandem. I've included markers for all years 
between 1993 and 2007. If you want too know the relative positions of Earth and 
Mars for years before or after those indicated, just add or subtract any 
multiple of 15 to the numbers given on the markings (i.e. 1975 is the same as 
&nbsp;1990, which is the same as 2005, 2020, 2035, etc.)<BR><BR>If you want to 
know what constellation to find Mars in at night, lay a straight edge between 
Mars and Earth and then visualize a parallel line extending from the sun in the 
same direction. Thus, during February 1993, Mars was in the Month of Cancer, but 
a line parallel to Earth-Mars drawn through the Sun at that time would go 
through Gemini, and this is the constellation Mars was seen in by observers on 
Earth at that time. At the same time, any observers located on Mars would have 
seen Earth in Sagittarius.&nbsp;</P>

<H2>A Private Initiative to Send Humans to Mars</H2>
<P><B>By: Robert Zubrin</B></P>
<P>Mars is the new frontier. The only world aside from Earth in our solar system 
with sufficient resources to support life and, someday, a new branch of human 
civilization, the Red Planet poses the central challenge faced by our era of 
history.</P>
<P><I>Humanity: Do you have what it takes to leave your cradle Earth to become a 
multi-planet species?</I></P>
<P>It is now clear that millions of people around the world are ready and 
willing to answer this challenge in the affirmative. On July 4, 1997, when 
NASA's Pathfinder probe landed on Mars, there were 100 million hits on the 
mission web site. That is more than the number of people who vote in the United 
States in a presidential election! It is more than the total number of Americans 
actively for or against abortion, gun control, nationalized health care, or a 
balanced budget, combined. Since the landing there have 700 million more hits. 
Even assuming a significant repeat rate, the number is simply phenomenal.</P>
<P>Yet despite this massive demonstration of support for Mars exploration, the 
politicians in charge and their consultants and astrologers, appear deaf to the 
call, providing virtually no government funding to prepare the way for human 
Mars exploration. This has caused tremendous public frustration, exemplified for 
me by the fact that since the publication of my book The Case for Mars, in 
October 1996, I have received over 3000 letters or e-mails from people asking me 
if there was any way we could initiate a human Mars exploration privately.</P>
<P>I initially thought it impossible. However the public response to the 
Pathfinder mission has convinced me otherwise. After all 700 million hits! At $1 
each that would be enough to fund four Pathfinder missions. At $10 each, that 
would be $7 billion, probably enough to fund a human Mars mission if done 
privately. But how does one get the credibility required to mobilize the funding 
that such broad based support represents?</P>
<H3>The Mars Society</H3>
<P>There is one way that can be done; by forming an organization that initiates 
a program of activity, which in a series of escalating steps, proves to all 
concerned that a real private Mars exploration effort is underway. This is the 
method that Jacques Cousteau employed to raise resources for a series of 
increasingly ambitious undersea exploration ventures. It is to carry out such a 
program that the Mars Society is being formed, with the Founding Convention to 
take place in Boulder Colorado August 13-16 of this year.</P>
<P>Unless we are unexpectedly lucky with fundraising, we will have to start 
small, perhaps with a hitchhiker payload or instrument flying on a NASA or ESA 
Mars probe. This could probably be managed at a cost of about $5 million. Once 
that is done, however, it should elevate the public profile of the Society 
enough to allow the raising of funds on the order of $100 million, sufficient to 
finance a complete private robotic exploration mission. My favorite candidate 
for such a mission would be a Mars aerial photography mission carried out with 
balloons, although there are many exciting alternative options, including long 
distance ground rovers, orbiters with ground penetrating radar to search for 
subsurface water, and others. If a private organization were to be successful in 
implementing any mission of this type, the public excitement generated all over 
the world could well be sufficient to allow billions of dollars to be raised, 
enough to fund human Mars exploration either by the Society acting alone, or 
perhaps on a cost-sharing basis with NASA or other government space 
agencies.</P>
<P>The Society's planned private Mars exploration effort and NASA's are not 
exclusive. On the contrary, because every government effort pursuing Mars 
exploration or technology development assists the cause and reduces the funding 
burden of the private initiative, the Society will also engage in broad outreach 
to instill the vision of pioneering Mars into the public and mobilize support 
for ever for aggressive government-funded robotic and human Mars exploration 
efforts.</P>
<P>A preliminary steering committee for the Society has been formed, which 
includes Mike Griffin, former NASA Associate Administrator for exploration, 
myself, NASA scientists Christopher McKay and Carol Stoker, science fiction 
author Kim Stanley Robinson, and many others. The Founding Convention of the 
Mars Society will be a historic step, one that may be remembered for centuries 
to come on the new world it opens. But history is not a spectator sport. We need 
your talents and energy if the initiative is to succeed.</P>
